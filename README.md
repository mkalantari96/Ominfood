## Project Description

In this project, I aimed to create a webpage with the following features:

##### Sticky Navigation Bar:

- Implemented a navigation bar that sticks to the top of the viewport when the user scrolls down past the hero section. This functionality was achieved using JavaScript (ES6) to dynamically adjust the navigation bar's position.

##### Responsive Design:

- Ensured the webpage and navigation bar are fully responsive and compatible with all platforms and devices.
- Utilized media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
- Employed `rem` and `em` units for a flexible and scalable design.

##### Modern CSS Techniques:

- Applied modern CSS techniques to enhance the design and functionality of the webpage, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

##### JavaScript (ES6):

- Used ES6 features in JavaScript to create a more efficient and cleaner codebase.
